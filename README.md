# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This PreWork Study Guide was created to help me prepare and study for the Boot Camp. This project was built, since coding a simple projct like this is the best to begin familiarizing myself with coding concepts. This project solves the problem of me not having much coding experience by encouraging me to begin coding. I learned about HTML elements, the imporance of CSS as an aesthetic tool for HTML, JavaScript functions, along with many more concepts.

## Usage

This PreWork Study Guide can be used as a framework for notes. There are several sections within the study guide that are broken out by the coding languages we will be studying. This includes HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git. I can use this study guide as a reference to ideas and concepts I'm learning.

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
